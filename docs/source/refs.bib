	abstract = {In this article, we consider the problem of detecting multiple changepoints in large datasets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example, in genetics as we analyze larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimizing a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalized likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost, which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favorably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies, we show that our new method can...},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic cells express transcription factor (TF) paralogues that bind to nearly identical DNA sequences in vitro but bind at different genomic loci and perform different functions in vivo. Predicting how 2 paralogous TFs bind in vivo using DNA sequence alone is an important open problem. Here, we analyzed 2 yeast bHLH TFs, Cbf1p and Tye7p, which have highly similar binding preferences in vitro, yet bind at almost completely nonoverlapping target loci in vivo. We dissected the determinants of specificity for these 2 proteins by making a number of chimeric TFs in which we swapped different domains of Cbf1p and Tye7p and determined the effects on in vivo binding and cellular function. From these experiments, we learned that the Cbf1p dimer achieves its specificity by binding cooperatively with other Cbf1p dimers bound nearby. In contrast, we found that Tye7p achieves its specificity by binding cooperatively with 3 other DNA-binding proteins, Gcr1p, Gcr2p, and Rap1p. Remarkably, most promoters (63\%) that are bound by Tye7p do not contain a consensus Tye7p binding site. Using this information, we were able to build simple models to accurately discriminate bound and unbound genomic loci for both Cbf1p and Tye7p. We then successfully reprogrammed the human bHLH NPAS2 to bind Cbf1p in vivo targets and a Tye7p target intergenic region to be bound by Cbf1p. These results demonstrate that the genome-wide binding targets of paralogous TFs can be discriminated using sequence information, and provide lessons about TF specificity that can be applied across the phylogenetic tree.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) enact precise regulation of gene expression through site-specific, genome-wide binding. Common methods for TF-occupancy profiling, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation, are limited by requirement of TF-specific antibodies and provide only end-point snapshots of TF binding. Alternatively, TF-tagging techniques, in which a TF is fused to a DNA-modifying enzyme that marks TF-binding events across the genome as they occur, do not require TF-specific antibodies and offer the potential for unique applications, such as recording of TF occupancy over time and cell type specificity through conditional expression of the TF–enzyme fusion. Here, we create a viral toolkit for one such method, calling cards, and demonstrate that these reagents can be delivered to the live mouse brain and used to report TF occupancy. Further, we establish a Cre-dependent calling cards system and, in proof-of-principle experiments, show utility in defining cell type-specific TF profiles and recording and integrating TF-binding events across time. This versatile approach will enable unique studies of TF-mediated gene regulation in live animal models.},

            We report a tool, Calling Cards Reporter Arrays (CCRA), that measures transcription factor (TF) binding and the consequences on gene expression for hundreds of synthetic promoters in yeast. Using Cbf1p and MAX, we demonstrate that the CCRA method is able to detect small changes in binding free energy with a sensitivity comparable to in vitro methods, enabling the measurement of energy landscapes in vivo. We then demonstrate the quantitative analysis of cooperative interactions by measuring Cbf1p binding at synthetic promoters with multiple sites. We find that the cooperativity between Cbf1p dimers varies sinusoidally with a period of 10.65 bp and energetic cost of 1.37 KBT for sites that are positioned ‘out of phase’. Finally, we characterize the binding and expression of a group of TFs, Tye7p, Gcr1p and Gcr2p, that act together as a ‘TF collective’, an important but poorly characterized model of TF cooperativity. We demonstrate that Tye7p often binds promoters without its recognition site because it is recruited by other collective members, whereas these other members require their recognition sites, suggesting a hierarchy where these factors recruit Tye7p but not vice versa. Our experiments establish CCRA as a useful tool for quantitative investigations into TF binding and function.},

	abstract = {Summary: Transposon calling cards is a genomic assay for identifying transcription factor binding sites in both bulk and single cell experiments. Here we describe the qBED format, an open, text-based standard for encoding and analyzing calling card data. In parallel, we introduce the qBED track on the WashU Epigenome Browser, a novel visualization that enables researchers to inspect calling card data in their genomic context. Finally, through examples, we demonstrate that qBED files can be used to visualize non-calling card datasets, such as CADD scores and GWAS hits, and may have broad utility to the genomics community. Availability and Implementation: The qBED track is available on the WashU Epigenome Browser (http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser), beginning with version 50.3.6. Source code for the WashU Epigenome Browser with qBED support is available on GitHub (http://github.com/arnavm/eg-react and http://github.com/lidaof/eg-react). We have also released a tutorial on how to upload qBED data to the browser (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bca8ishw).},
